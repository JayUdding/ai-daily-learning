**TERMINAL USE**

Day 3--learning some Terminal usabe, played with it and learned some basics

Used this tutorial https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html

**COMMANDS**

**ls  list
then: -l get more details**
**The ~ shows where you are in the file system of the Mac. ~ is a shortcut that means the current user’s Home folder. 
The % is a character that the shell (the default interface that Terminal uses) displays to indicate that it’s ready to accept a command.**

The point is that ls can provide additional information about files and folders, depending on the options you specify. In this case, that additional information includes the name of the user who owns each item in the directory. (That ownership is part of the Unix system’s file-permissions regime.)
You can view invisible files—ones that the Finder doesn’t normally show you—by typing **ls -a.** (These hidden files all have dots (.) in front of their names.)

****cd (or change directory) command** So let’s say you’re in your Home folder and want to peek inside the Downloads folder. To do that, you’d type cd Downloads.

If you type cd and press the Return key—with no directory specified—you’ll go back to your Home folder. (You can also type cd ~ to go there.)

****If you type cd /, you’ll go to the root level of your startup disk**

If you type cd .. (that’s two periods), you’ll go to the directory above the one you’re currently in. So if you’re in your home folder, and type cd .., you’ll go to your Mac’s /Users folder.

And if you type cd - (hyphen) you’ll go back to the directory you were in before the last time you issued the cd command.
