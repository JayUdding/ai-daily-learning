Daily GitHub commits as I learn with my trusted CoPilot and the Terminal

FIRST OFF--LEARN MORE ABOUT THE TERMINAL, HOW TO USE IT

**TERMINAL USE**

Learning some Terminal usabe, played with it and learned some basics

Used this tutorial

**COMMANDS TO MEMORIZE**

Blinking cursor is where the command line starts
We see user name followed by possibly the directory we are in (ie. Desktop), followed by % sign.
If we press return/enter then a new command line presents.
Commands are only executed in the directory we are in at the moment.
We can't interact with the terminal with the mouse (but we can use it to place the cursor). You can only use the arrow keys and keyboard. 
The UP arrow is useful to select previous commands used in the session.


UP ARROW--goes through previous commands

clear --use this to clear the terminal

man--get to a manual

itconfig --checks IP address and related

netstat --lists network configurations

**ls  list**

**-l get more details**

**The ~ shows where you are in the file system of the Mac. ~ is a shortcut that means the current user’s Home folder.** 

**The % is a character that the shell (the default interface that Terminal uses) displays to indicate that it’s ready to accept a command.The % sign is just there to show you where your line command starts. If you press return, you’ll see another line with a % sign, indicating that the previous line has been abandoned.**

The point is that ls can provide additional information about files and folders, depending on the options you specify. In this case, that additional information includes the name of the user who owns each item in the directory. (That ownership is part of the Unix system’s file-permissions regime.)
You can view invisible files—ones that the Finder doesn’t normally show you—by typing **ls -a.** (These hidden files all have dots (.) in front of their names.)

**cd (or change directory) command** So let’s say you’re in your Home folder and want to peek inside the Downloads folder. To do that, you’d type cd Downloads.

If you type cd and press the Return key—with no directory specified—you’ll go back to your Home folder. (You can also type cd ~ to go there.)

**If you type cd /, you’ll go to the root level of your startup disk**

ALSO NOTE VARIOUS PODCASTS

If you type **cd ..** (that’s two periods), you’ll go to the directory above the one you’re currently in. So if you’re in your home folder, and type cd .., you’ll go to your Mac’s /Users folder. This is like a Back Button

And if you type cd - (hyphen) you’ll go back to the directory you were in before the last time you issued the cd command.



**Terminal is the built-in shell environment on Mac that allows you to directly issue UNIX commands. The Mac terminal works via commands. Unlike a traditional app (or GUI app), where you navigate by clicking buttons with the mouse, the terminal is a LUI app. This means you interact with the terminal by typing in keywords and phrases (i.e., commands) that tell the terminal what to do.**

Homebrew is what’s known as a package manager. All this means is that you can install packages (i.e., apps) using Homebrew. Think of it as the App Store but for your Mac’s terminal.




**history, clear, *****, and sudo**

history -- gives the history of commands made in the session
clear --  does clear the window back to a basic command line where we were
* --  wildcard symbol --returns all with the reference to follow it. eg. *.pdf
sudo -- means you are using as an administrator, superuser--and you are overriding protections!
say --will make computer talk

Once you get the hang of moving around the Mac terminal, you’re ready to start learning the fundamental commands. In my opinion, that means understanding how history, clear, *, and sudo work.

**history** is a straightforward command. It shows you a brief history of the commands you’ve recently entered into the terminal. This is helpful when you need to remember what you’ve done so far.

**clear** This is arguably a pointless command, though I use it a lot. When you enter clear into the Mac terminal, it clears the window back to a basic terminal screen. Go ahead and try it.

**`*`** This isn’t so much a command as it is an important symbol to be familiar with. It’s known as the “wildcard” symbol and is used to reference anything within certain criteria.

**sudo** is used to run commands as a superuser, or as an admin. It means that you’re overriding some basic protection of your Mac and making an alteration to your computer

NOTE: Deleting a file will also remove any associated commits on my commit chart! It pays to not delete!

Need to use Maple IA in addition to CoPilot--

Here are some of the notes provided by maple

Commit Template:

Create a new file named .gitmessage in your project's root directory.
Add a template for your commit messages, e.g., feat: [brief description].
Configure Git to use the template by running git config --global commit.template .gitmessage.
Automating Tasks and Workflows:

Learn about GitHub Actions: https://docs.github.com/en/actions
Create a new file in your project's .github/workflows directory, e.g., deploy.yml.
Define a workflow using YAML syntax, e.g., name: Deploy, on: push, jobs: deploy.
Use GitHub Actions to automate tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying your project.
Free Website or Blog:

Create a new repository on GitHub: https://github.com/new
Choose a template or start from scratch.
Use GitHub Pages to host your website or blog: https://pages.github.com/
Configure your repository to use GitHub Pages by going to Settings > GitHub Pages.
Using GitHub for Your Website or Blog:

Create a new branch for your website or blog, e.g., gh-pages.
Configure your repository to use GitHub Pages by going to Settings > GitHub Pages.
Use Markdown files to create content for your website or blog.
Use Jekyll or other static site generators to build and deploy your website or blog.
Git Hooks:

Learn about Git hooks: https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks
Create a new file in your project's .git/hooks directory, e.g., pre-commit.
Write a script to perform a specific action before committing, e.g., echo "Remember to update the README".
Scheduled Commit Tool:

Use git commit --allow-empty to create an empty commit.
Use a scheduling tool like cron (on Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to run the command at regular intervals.
Alternatively, use a tool like github-scheduler to schedule commits.
Terminal Benefits:

Faster workflow: The terminal allows you to perform tasks quickly and efficiently.
Version control: The terminal is essential for using Git and other version control systems.
Coding: The terminal is where you'll spend most of your time as a coder, using tools like compilers, interpreters, and debuggers.
AI and data science: The terminal is used extensively in AI and data science for tasks like data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
Vibecoding: The terminal is where you'll use tools like vibe to create and manage your projects.
Getting Started with the Terminal:

Learn basic commands: cd, ls, mkdir, rm, cp, mv.
Practice navigating directories: Use cd and ls to move around your file system.
Learn about Git: Use git init, git add, git commit, git push, and git pull to manage your projects.
Install a code editor: Use a terminal-based code editor like vim or nano to write code.
Explore terminal tools: Learn about tools like curl, wget, and ssh to perform tasks like downloading files and accessing remote servers.
