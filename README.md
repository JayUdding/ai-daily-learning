FIRST OFF--LEARN MORE ABOUT THE TERMINAL, HOW TO USE IT

**TERMINAL USE**

Learning some Terminal usabe, played with it and learned some basics

Used this tutorial https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html

**COMMANDS**

**ls  list**

**-l get more details**

**The ~ shows where you are in the file system of the Mac. ~ is a shortcut that means the current user’s Home folder.** 

**The % is a character that the shell (the default interface that Terminal uses) displays to indicate that it’s ready to accept a command.The % sign is just there to show you where your line command starts. If you press return, you’ll see another line with a % sign, indicating that the previous line has been abandoned.**

The point is that ls can provide additional information about files and folders, depending on the options you specify. In this case, that additional information includes the name of the user who owns each item in the directory. (That ownership is part of the Unix system’s file-permissions regime.)
You can view invisible files—ones that the Finder doesn’t normally show you—by typing **ls -a.** (These hidden files all have dots (.) in front of their names.)

**cd (or change directory) command** So let’s say you’re in your Home folder and want to peek inside the Downloads folder. To do that, you’d type cd Downloads.

If you type cd and press the Return key—with no directory specified—you’ll go back to your Home folder. (You can also type cd ~ to go there.)

**If you type cd /, you’ll go to the root level of your startup disk**

ALSO NOTE VARIOUS PODCASTS

If you type **cd ..** (that’s two periods), you’ll go to the directory above the one you’re currently in. So if you’re in your home folder, and type cd .., you’ll go to your Mac’s /Users folder. This is like a Back Button

And if you type cd - (hyphen) you’ll go back to the directory you were in before the last time you issued the cd command.

Another Tutorial that I studied:

**Terminal is the built-in shell environment on Mac that allows you to directly issue UNIX commands. The Mac terminal works via commands. Unlike a traditional app (or GUI app), where you navigate by clicking buttons with the mouse, the terminal is a LUI app. This means you interact with the terminal by typing in keywords and phrases (i.e., commands) that tell the terminal what to do.**

Homebrew is what’s known as a package manager. All this means is that you can install packages (i.e., apps) using Homebrew. Think of it as the App Store but for your Mac’s terminal.


You may have already noticed, but you can’t interact with the terminal with your mouse. You can only use the arrow keys and keyboard. That means you can’t highlight text or copy/paste text in the terminal.

**history, clear, *****, and sudo**

Once you get the hang of moving around the Mac terminal, you’re ready to start learning the fundamental commands. In my opinion, that means understanding how history, clear, *, and sudo work.

**history** is a straightforward command. It shows you a brief history of the commands you’ve recently entered into the terminal. This is helpful when you need to remember what you’ve done so far.

**clear** This is arguably a pointless command, though I use it a lot. When you enter clear into the Mac terminal, it clears the window back to a basic terminal screen. Go ahead and try it.

**`*`** This isn’t so much a command as it is an important symbol to be familiar with. It’s known as the “wildcard” symbol and is used to reference anything within certain criteria.

**sudo** is used to run commands as a superuser, or as an admin. It means that you’re overriding some basic protection of your Mac and making an alteration to your computer

NOTE: Deleting a file will also remove any associated commits on my commit chart! It pays to not delete!
